# Jaanu-sAcademy-FrontEnd-web-development
I have created a front-end website page for a dance class portal. I have used Html,Css,Bootstrap and Javascript. There are four pages namely Home, Classes offered, About and Registration.
The pages are responsive with respect to various screen sizes. I have created the Hamburger menu using css and Javascript Toggle function.
In the classes offered page, I have used BootStrap v5.0 components, namely cards to present the content.
There a minor text-animations in the website. I imported the icons from Icons8 website.
